I started doing the assignment on a different project folder rather than the original, this was due to
not understanding how github and commits worked, and so i've been working on the html and css part of my main page.
26/02/2025 I learnt how to make commits and push them to my respitory on github, 
this was especially hard because I had many errors come about that I couldn't understand how to resolve. The made errors were
that I forgot to commit the files after adding them, or that in the beginning I had used 'git push u- origin main'
Even though my origin was master, I learnt how to check by using git branch
